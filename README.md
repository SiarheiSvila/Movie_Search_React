# React movie search app

## Description:
Pure React app that allows searching movies available at [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

This application contains only one page that loads data dynamically. To find the movie, type its name at the search bar. The application makes a call to [themoviedb's](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API and retrieves all movies that suited the search including their poster, title, release date, average rating, and description.





## To run:
Download this repo, make sure `npm` and `nodejs` packages are installed on your computer.

Under the parent folder create a new called `node_modules` and put standart node modules files there. I hope, you are familiar with this :).

Navigate to the project's parent folder and run the command:
```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
yarn start
```

## Usage and Screenshots:
So, you've started the application. Let's now find some Jurrassic park movies. To do this Type `Jurassic Park` at the seach bar and click `Search`. All Jurrasic Park movies are displayed correctly:
